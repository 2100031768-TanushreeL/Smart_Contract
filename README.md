# Smart_Contract
Stepts to create a Smart Contract project
1. Open Remix IDE (or any Solidity Compiler)
2. Create a contract with sufix .sol
3. Compile the contract
4. Deploy the contract

# Ganache 
1. Open Ganache in your desktop 
2. Click on Quick start
3. Copy the private key 

# Metamask
1. Create an account in metamask
2. Connect Metamask with your Ganache
3. Add new account -> import account -> paste the private key (key copied from ganache).
4. By clicking on send we can transfer some Ethers to another account.

# Compilation Steps

To compile the smart contract, you can use the Solidity compiler.

# Deploy
1. While Deploying change Enviromment to **Injected Provider - MetaMask**
2. After injecting the meatamask you will get the address to interact with contract

# Checking the output
1. In Deployed section add input then call_function
2. Output will be displayed and Transaction is made.
